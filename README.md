# UI-Motion-Components-Pack-SVGator
A collection of animated UI components created using SVGator.

This project demonstrates practical UI motion design skills including micro-interactions, loaders, and notification feedback animations.

🎯 Project Overview

This project includes:

Circular Spinner Loader

Bouncing Dots Loader

Notification Bell with Swing Animation

Notification Dot Pop Effect

All animations were built from scratch using SVG shapes and timeline-based keyframes.

No pre-made assets or external libraries were used.

🛠 Tools Used

SVGator (Free Plan)

SVG Shapes (Ellipse, Rectangle)

Timeline Keyframes

Transform Animations

Easing Controls

🎬 Animations Included
1️⃣ Circular Spinner Loader

Stroke-based circle

Continuous rotation (0° → 360°)

Linear easing

Infinite loop animation

Concepts applied:

Rotation transforms

Transform origin

Stroke styling

2️⃣ Bouncing Dots Loader

Three sequential animated dots

Position (Y-axis bounce)

Staggered timing

Ease-in-out motion

Concepts applied:

Motion rhythm

Sequential animation

Visual loading feedback

3️⃣ Notification Bell Animation

Custom-built bell using SVG shapes

Proper pivot origin placement

Realistic swing motion

Notification dot pop effect (scale animation)

Concepts applied:

Transform origin control

Rotation keyframes

Scale multiplier animation

Motion hierarchy (dot first → bell swing)

UI feedback animation principles

🧠 Motion Design Principles Applied

Timing & spacing

Easing curves

Visual hierarchy

Micro-interaction feedback

UI animation consistency
